                            <p>I am a full stack web developer and a student for life. 

As a developer you are required to learn continually, 
the moment you stop improving on existing skills, you start to fall behind. 
I strive to learn new things, gaining experience and experimenting with technology. 
 Web development provides an excellent outlet to express creativity and allows for a 
 serious mental stimulation and that is why I chose web development as a career. 
 I am currently practicing my listed skills and looking for an opportunity to use
  them to solve real world problems in an engaging work environment. </p>
