                            As a developer, you have to embrace continual education, because the moment you stop improving on existing skills, you begin to fall behind. I am a full stack web developer and a student of life who strives to learn and gain new experience while experimenting with technology.  Web development provides an excellent outlet to express creativity and allows for a serious mental stimulation and that is why I chose web development as a career.  I am currently practicing my listed skills and looking for an opportunity to use them to solve real world problems in an engaging work environment. </p>
